                        Ije has a background in industrial engineering and worked in consulting for ~2.5 years before returning to school for her Master's Degree in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). She is passionate about inclusion in technology and design and aims to address the needs and challenges of underrepresented groups. This capstone project has opened the door for her to do just that.

                        "The pandemic has affected us all in different ways, some more severely than others. I am so grateful to have the opportunity to work with Pandemic Professors and help families and children who are truly in need. Throughout high school and college, I often babysat and tutored children from underserved communities. For this reason (and more), I feel connected to Pandemic Professors’ cause, and want to help children and families from these communities succeed."

                        Before coming to the Master of HCI program, Gabbi studied Computer Science and Cognitive Psychology at Bucknell University, where she graduated in May 2020. Though her background is in programming, she has pivoted into a User Research role for both Capstone and after graduation. Nonetheless, she looks forward to helping out with any coding necessary in the project.

                        "When the pandemic first hit, I remember hearing how difficult the switch to remote learning was for my teacher-friend’s students. I was especially disheartened when I learned of the disproportionate effects COVID has on lower-income communities. I’m excited to get to work with Pandemic Professors for my Master’s Capstone project, hopefully helping make a difference in students’ lives who most need our support right now."

                    <p>
                        I graduated from UCLA in 2019 with a double major in Communications and Political Science. From there, I worked as a UX/UI designer for a mental health research initiative for 1.5 years. I’m particularly passionate about designing solutions around healthcare, sustainability, and accessibility. This project is really exciting and I’m looking forward to working in this design space with the rest of my team!

There’s a lot of work to be made in improving access to quality education but organizations like Pandemic Professors help us move in the right direction. I look forward to helping the organization accomplish its goals."

                        Prior to MHCI, Brady attended Oregon State University, graduating in Spring of 2020 with a double major in Psychology and New Media Communications. During his time there he developed an interest in research, working in a cognition lab that utilized VR technology to simulate environments. Since coming to Carnegie Mellon University, he has continued to hone his research skills with user testing experience as well as a research assistant position in a game design lab focused on designing and testing VR environments.

                        "My family is full of educators. Both of my parents are public school teachers. I have seen the toll of this pandemic and distanced learning through them: students are struggling to stay connected and schools are struggling to adapt in the online environment. It’s clear that under-privileged students are being hit the hardest, and the problem isn’t getting any better on its own. I’m excited to get the opportunity to make a real difference for the students who need it most!"
